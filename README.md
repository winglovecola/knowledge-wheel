# Knowledge Wheel



## Description

I have built a simple application using JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and the Google Book API. I was inspired by the Ferris wheel, which to me represents fun and foresight, and books, which symbolize knowledge. Combining these two elements, I created this small yet meaningful application.

Through this app, I also demonstrate my proficiency in using JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and API.
